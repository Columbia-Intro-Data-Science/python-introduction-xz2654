## Mission Statement:
We had realized that some of good movies were surprisingly panned by critics, but had been very popular by general audiences. A large portion of movies had had a poor TOMATOMETER score (from critics), but a positive audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. So we decided to build our own recommendation engine that specifically focused on recommending those films based on user's movie taste.

## Dataset
We use [MovieLens-Latest](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) and [HetRec 2011](https://grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec-2011/) datasets from Grouplens, a research group at University of Minnesota.
