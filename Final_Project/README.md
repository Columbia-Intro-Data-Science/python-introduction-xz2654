## Mission Statement:
We had realized that some of good movies were surprisingly panned by critics, but had been very popular by general audiences. A large portion of movies had had a poor TOMATOMETER score (from critics), but a positive audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. So we decided to build our own recommendation engine that specifically focused on recommending those films based on user's movie taste.

## Dataset
We use [MovieLens Latest Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) from Grouplens.

## Analysis/Work
Please find the [IPython file]() illustrating our analysis and work.
